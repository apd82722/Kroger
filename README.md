## Problem Descrption

Our team decided to model a database that describes the inventory, transaction, and ordering system for Kroger. In our group's project we made 12 entities to describe the problem outlined above, along with the relationships between the entities to create a full data model. From the perspective of the store we modeled stores and departments to separate the inventory and order process by departments. From there we added inventory related entities and also transactions between customers and the store to change the inventory entity and provide an accurate total of items in the department of the store. On the other side of the data model we made a way to track the replenishment of inventory through orders from Krogers vendors. This would act like: “The seafood department is running out of fish, they order more fish from the fish vendor, get the invoice, and get the items delivered.” This scenario outlines the process of our solution for Kroger’s orders along with lists of items in the order, vendor names, delivery descriptions, invoices, and payments from the store to the vendor.
